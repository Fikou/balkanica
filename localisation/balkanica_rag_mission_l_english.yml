 rag_italian_neogtiation_desc:0 "Not all Italian states are our enemies. In fact, the enemy of our enemy is, logically, our friend. We should negotiate with the Italian states on the opposite side of the peninsula, to find common ground and perhaps even form an alliance against Venice and Naples."

 rag_temples_title:0 "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Temple Complex"
 rag_temples_desc:0 "Being an inadvertent bulwark of Christianity in the Balkans, [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has become an important city for Catholic refugees and pilgrims alike. To accommodate the influx of people, we should build a grand temple complex in the city, which will not only serve as a place of worship, but also as a mighty fortress to protect the city from any would-be conquerors."

 rag_conquer_venice_desc:0 "The Venitians thought us weak, but we proved them wrong, and took their Dalmatian possessions. The Venetians thought us insignificant, but we proved them wrong, and expelled them from the Adriatic. The Venetians thought us a mere city-state, but we will prove them wrong again and again, until Venezia has fallen."

 rag_illyria_title:0 "Illyrian Dreams"
 rag_illyria_desc:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] has grown strong, and our borders have expanded. We have taken lands from the Venetians, the Bosnians, and the Serbians, and we have secured our place as the dominant power in the Adriatic.\n\nBut we shall not stop there. Our patricians dream of a new Illyria, freeing the Balkans from the yoke of the Ottomans and the Hungarians, and uniting the region under our banner."

 rag_mutual_allies_title:0 "Find Mutual Allies"

 rag_serb_gold_title:0 "Exploit Serbian Silver"

 rag_dev_rag_desc:0 "We have collected a great deal of wealth from our trade between the east and the west, and it is time to invest it in our own city. [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will be the envy of the Adriatic - nay - the entire Mediterranean. We will build grand palaces, magnificent temples, and mighty fortresses.

 rag_egypt_title:0 "Trade of Alexandria"
 rag_egypt_desc:0 "Egypt is a land of great wealth, and more importantly, one of the main routes for trade beyond the Levant. If we want to expand our trade, especially in spices and other luxury goods, we cannot allow the Mamluks to control the region, and potentially cut us off from Asia."

 rag_fleetmax_title:0 "Hoist the Sails"
 rag_fleetmax_desc:0 "In order to protect our trade interests, it is time to build a powerful navy. We should focus on building a fleet of galleys to contest the Venitians and Genoans, or a fleet of light ships to protect our trade interests.\n\nAdditionally, it would be wise to raise a central shipyard in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to maintain these new ships."

 rag_expanding_markets_title:0 "Expanding our Markets"

 ragusa_flavor.1.desc:0 "Not 100 years ago, our mightly [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] achieved independence from the Republic of Venice. Ever since, we have been situated on a knife's edge. While our regular payments to the Kingdom of Hungary and Ottoman Sultanate have kept us safe, we are still at risk of being our agreements falling through, leaving us vulnerable to the Venetians once more.\n\nIt has been suggested by many patricians that we consider a formal tributary agreement with the [ragusa_tributary_sovereign.GetAdjective] [ragusa_tributary_sovereign.GovernmentName] in order to secure our independence.\n\nWhile this would mean a loss of some of our sovereignty and autonomy, it would also offer us a guarantee of protection from our enemies - so long as we continue to pay our dues."
